hw3-password
In this homework we were assigned the task of completing this password generator. In this assignment I used the JavaScript that we learned this week in class to have this generator ask us questions. Some of these questions involved "Would you like to use special characters?" or "would You like to have uppercases in your password?". I was able to solve the problem in this generator by assign variables, arrays, if else statements etc. To achieve the end goal I relied on my variables and having them properly assigned and given a specific set of numbers or characters. I also used the Prompt to give the message the user first see's after clicking in the generate password button. After using prompt, I used confirm to give the user a message to read while at the same time giving them choices to pick from.
